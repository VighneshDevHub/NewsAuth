            <h3>What is NewsGuard AI?</h3>
            <p>
              NewsGuard AI is an advanced platform that uses artificial
              intelligence to verify the authenticity of news articles. Our
              system analyzes content, cross-references with trusted sources,
              and provides a comprehensive authenticity score to help users
              identify reliable information.

            <h3>How accurate is NewsGuard AI?</h3>
            <p>
              Our AI system has been trained on thousands of verified news
              articles and continuously improves its accuracy. While no system
              is perfect, NewsGuard AI typically achieves over 90% accuracy in
              identifying misinformation and fake news when compared to human
              fact-checkers.

            <h3>Is NewsGuard AI free to use?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, the basic version of NewsGuard AI is free for individual
              users. We also offer premium plans with additional features for
              journalists, organizations, and educational institutions that
              require more comprehensive analysis tools.

            <h3>How does NewsGuard AI analyze news articles?</h3>
            <p>
              Our system uses a multi-layered approach: First, it extracts key
              information from the article. Then, it cross-references this
              information with trusted sources. Finally, it evaluates factors
              like factual accuracy, source consistency, detail accuracy, and
              contextual relevance to generate an authenticity score.

            <h3>What AI models power NewsGuard AI?</h3>
            <p>
              NewsGuard AI uses a combination of large language models (LLMs)
              and custom-trained neural networks specifically designed for news
              content analysis. Our system incorporates natural language
              processing, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to evaluate
              news authenticity.

            <h3>
              Can NewsGuard AI analyze content in languages other than English?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Currently, NewsGuard AI primarily supports English content, with
              limited capabilities in Spanish and French. We're actively working
              on expanding our language support to include more global languages
              in future updates.

          <div class="card faq-card">
            <h3>How does NewsGuard AI handle paywalled content?</h3>
            <p>
              NewsGuard AI cannot directly analyze content behind paywalls.
              However, it can still provide partial analysis based on publicly
              available information about the article, including headlines,
              excerpts, and metadata.

              NewsGuard AI's verification capabilities into their own
              applications. Contact our team for API documentation and access
